Frontend (React) --> Backend (Django) --> Database (PostgreSQL)

- The React frontend interacts with the Django backend via HTTP requests.
- Django backend processes these requests, interacts with the PostgreSQL database for data operations, and sends responses back to the React frontend.
- All components are containerized using Docker and communicate within a Docker network.
