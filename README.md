## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

**Frontend (React)** ‚û°Ô∏è **Backend (Django)** ‚û°Ô∏è **Database (PostgreSQL)**  

1. **Frontend (React)**:  
   The user interacts with the application through the React-based frontend. HTTP requests are made to the backend API for data operations.

2. **Backend (Django)**:  
   The Django backend receives requests from the React frontend, processes them, interacts with the PostgreSQL database, and returns appropriate responses.

3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**:  
   PostgreSQL stores all notes data, ensuring reliability and scalability for data operations.

4. **Dockerized Setup**:  
   All components (frontend, backend, and database) are containerized using Docker, and communication happens within a shared Docker network.
